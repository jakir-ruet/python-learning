A **module** in Python is a file that contains Python code—functions, classes, or variables—which can be reused in other programs. Modules help organize code into separate files, making it more maintainable and reusable.
- [Built-in Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html) (like `math`, `os`, `sys`, `datetime`)
- User-Defined Modules (Python files `.py` created by developers)
