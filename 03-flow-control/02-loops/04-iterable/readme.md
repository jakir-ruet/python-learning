An iterable is any object capable of returning its members one at a time, permitting it to be iterated over in a for-loop or with other iteration constructs (like map() or filter()).
Common examples of iterables in Python include:
- Lists (list)
- Tuples (tuple)
- Strings (str)
- Dictionaries (dict)
- Sets (set)
- Files (using file objects)
- Generators
